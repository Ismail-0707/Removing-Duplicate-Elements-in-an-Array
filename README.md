# ðŸ§© LeetCode 26 â€” Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array

## ðŸ“– Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums` **sorted in non-decreasing order**, remove the duplicates **in-place** such that each unique element appears only once.  
The relative order of the elements should be kept the same.  
Then, return the number of unique elements.

Since it's done **in-place**, you must modify the input array directly using **O(1)** extra memory.

---

## ðŸ’¡ Example

### Example 1:
```cpp
Input: nums = [1,1,2]
Output: 2, nums = [1,2,_]
Explanation:
- Your function should return k = 2,
- The first 2 elements of nums should be [1,2].
- It doesnâ€™t matter whatâ€™s left beyond the returned length.
